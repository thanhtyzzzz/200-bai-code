            <h4 class="section-title">Run the Messier Marathon</h4>                
            <p><img src="hinh/m20.jpg" style="display: float; border: 5px solid rgb(252,221,163);" align="right"> 
                It's time for the annual Messier Marathon. Instead of lacing up their Nikes, amateur astronomers will be
                hauling telescopes, star charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the Messier
                objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Messier objects are stellar objects, classified by astronomer Charles Messier in the 18th century,
                ranging from distant galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. Now is the only time of the year in
                which all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all of them, you have to
                start looking right after sunset and continue until just before sunrise - hence the term, "marathon."
            </p>
            <p>
                Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He made the list in order to avoid
                seeing them. Messier was more interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar objects
                kept getting in the way.

    <p style="color: red; text-align: justify;">
        The Northeast region had a mixed sales year last year. Some models like the C300-25 performed admirably, while others like the C200-20 had disappointing years. We anticipate a stronger year in current year with the introduction of the C300-30 model - a great copier at a competitive price.
